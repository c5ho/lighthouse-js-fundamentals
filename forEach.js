/*
 * Programming Quiz: Another Type of Loop (6-8)
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * Use the existing `test` variable and write a `forEach` loop
 * that adds 100 to each number that is divisible by 3.
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - Inside the loop, you must use an `if` statement to verify code is divisible by 3
 *  - Inside the loop, you can updade an element ONLY by using the arrayName[index]
 *  - Outside the loop, you can use `console.log` to verify the `test` variable

/*
 * Programming Quiz: I Got Bills (6-9)
 *
 * Use the .map() method to take the bills array below and create a second array
 * of numbers called totals. The totals array should contains each amount from the
 * bills array but with a 15% tip added. Log the totals array to the console.
 *
 * For example, the first two entries in the totals array would be:
 *
 * [57.76, 21.99, ... ]
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - each entry in the totals array must be a number
 *  - each number must have an accuracy of two decimal points
 */
 
 /*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should have the variables `bills` and `totals`
 * - Your `bills` array should call the `map()` method and store the return of `map()` in the `totals` array
 * - Your `totals` array should be an array of numbers
 * - Your code should print the `totals` array to the console
 * - The output must be as described above.
